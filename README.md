# Lyrics Generator through Long Short Term memory
Neural Network built for Text Generation Task, assigned for the 2st homework of the Knowledge Discovery course at UniCT

## Description

An LSTM trained on a dataset that contains 364 Rap Verses Compiled from 243 Songs by the american rapper and artist Kanye West.
At the end we obtained two models, one with lower loss, that is good in predicting the continue of an existent song by Kanye, and one with highest loss that is good in generating a new non existing song.


## Dataset
Data I have used:

## Usage

Upload the dataset provided and the .ipynb notebook on your Google Drive.

Open the .ipynb notebook on Google Colaboratory, and you will be able to run the cells.

You will find all the networks on the same jupyter notebook. In order to have a better automated experience, the script is built with the scope to train and print output from both two models.
